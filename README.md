Predicting Daily Stock Prices

i. a brief description of the project.
For this project, I will develop a simple statistical model that can be used to predict a stock's price for the next day based on patterns in previous closing prices. This algorithm will create a model that can be used for any stock, as long as the financial data is available. 

ii. the algorithm / library / methods that you want to use.
I will use linear regression and moving average. Linear regression will compare the previous closing prices of a stock and the current prices to identify trends. Moving averages will smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight long-term trends. Historical data will also be used to identify trends and patterns.
Libraries such as pandas, numpy, and matplotlib for data handling and visualization. In addition, I will use scikit-learn for regression modeling and accuracy evaluation using metrics such as Mean Squared Error or Mean Absolute Error.

iii. any data that you might need.
For this project, I will need historical stock price data over a few months (12 months) on daily closing prices to identify trends. I will use publicly available financial data from Yahoo Finance.

iv. the expected outcome.
From this project, a functional model that can predict a stock's closing price for the next day will be made. We can also compare the accuracy of the prediction by comparing it to the actual price.
